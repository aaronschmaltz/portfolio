# Google Drawings

## Introduction

With **Google Drawings**, multiple users can collaborate simultaneously to create digital graphics. Although the software’s features are limited compared to other graphic editors such as Adobe Photoshop, Google Drawings allows Hawaii Aquatics to store the files on **Shared Drives** in an accessible format that anyone on the team can edit. As you navigate through the steps, it is essential to note that each action is placed in sequential order. Some steps were deliberately included to work around the limitations or quirks of the software.

## Preparation

Before creating a **Google Drawing**, you must ensure that any external images you intend to import are in a compatible file format — only **JPG** and **PNG** images can be imported. If the file you want to import is a PDF, you must export a **JPG** or **PNG** image file from the PDF.

## Page setup

### Step 1

Open the location in the **Drive** where you want to save your **Google Drawing**. Right-click to make the context menu appear (avoid right-clicking on a preexisting file). Click **More** > **Google Drawings** to create a **Google Drawing**.

### Step 2

To edit the canvas size, click **File** and then **Page setup**.

**Note:** There is an important distinction between _canvas_ size and _image_ size. _Canvas_ refers to the fully editable area of the workspace (this includes the empty pixels, denoted by the checkered background pattern). Exported images will have the exact dimensions as the canvas; they will only contain content visible within the borders of the canvas (anything that goes outside the canvas will get cropped out during export). _Image_ size refers to the original dimensions of an image (not the canvas).

### Step 3

Click **Standard 4:3** and change the selected option to **Custom**. This allows you to input custom dimensions for your image (i.e., defining the canvas size).

### Step 4

Enter **width** (left) and **height** (right) dimensions that exceed the dimensions of your image. Select **Pixels** (the unit of measurement for digital graphics). Press **Apply**.

**Note:** If the _canvas size_ is smaller in width and height than the imported image, the image will be warped during import. Avoiding Google Drawings’ automated resizing is recommended since the image's original quality will get compromised.

### Step 5

Import your image by dragging and dropping the image directly from your computer onto the canvas.

Alternatively, you can navigate to the menu and click **Insert**. Click **Image** and then **Upload from computer**.

### Step 6

Copy the imported image by right-clicking on it and selecting **Copy**. Delete the image.

### Step 7

Return to **Page Setup** and enter the desired dimensions for your image. Press **OK**.

If you are having difficulties determining what dimensions you want to use, compare the image's original dimensions with your computer screen’s resolution. By comparing the differences in size, you should be able to approximate a canvas size sufficient to contain the portion of your image that you want to include in the **Drawing**.

**Note:** Unless otherwise specified, the standard width for Hawaii Aquatics images is 1200 pixels. The height will vary depending on the image's content but is usually a multiple of 20 pixels (e.g., 640 pixels) for consistency. If the portion of your image that you want to be displayed exceeds 1200 pixels in width, then you may need to follow the instructions listed in the prior Step (i.e., 6) and scale your image accordingly.

### Step 8

Paste the image that you recently deleted by right-clicking and then pressing **Paste**.

If **Steps 5–8** were performed correctly, the imported image will retain its original properties.

### Step 9

Select the image and position it so that the portion of the image you want displayed is contained within the borders of the canvas.

**Note:** In the screenshot below, the image is positioned so that its top-left corner is aligned with the top-left corner of the canvas. Red lines appear around the top and left sides of the canvas, indicating that the sides of the image are perfectly aligned.

## Cropping the image

Cropping entails the removal of unnecessary parts of an image so that only a portion of it is included in the final export. If the image's width and height dimensions exceed the respective dimensions of the export (i.e., the dimensions used for **Page setup**), then the image will need to be cropped. Conversely, if the image's dimensions are smaller than the intended final dimensions of the export, then the image will need to be upscaled. However, upscaling an image natively in **Google Drawings** is not recommended as it may compromise resolution and quality.

### Step 1

Select the image. Then, right-click the image and select **Crop Image**.

### Step 2

There are two selectable borders: **blue** and **black**. Selecting and moving the **black** border allows you to crop the image. Modifying the **blue** border will alter the size of the overall image (i.e., stretch) without cropping it.

### Step 3

Move each of the four sides (black borders) so that they snap to the side of the canvas (a blue line with cross marks will appear, indicating that the cropping of the image is in alignment with the edge of the canvas).

**Note:** If the original size of your image drastically exceeds that of your canvas size, it may help to crop the image in smaller, incremental amounts gradually.

## Exporting

### Step 1

To export the **Google Drawing**, go to **File** in the upper-left corner of the menu.

### Step 2

Navigate to the **Download** option and select the file type you want to download (JPG files are the default Hawaii Aquatics uses).
