This repository is a collection of my writing (and non-writing) samples, showcasing some of the work that I have done.

| [Google Drawings](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/guides/google-drawings.md) | Guide | An introductory guide on how to use the Google Drawings diagramming software. Originally intended for internal use where the users, with a limited graphics background, were primarily expected to modify preexisting images for content. |

I edited and wrote a significant portion of the proposal (roughly 50%). |
| [Kamaâ€™aina Kids](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/proposals/kamaaina-kids.md) | Proposal | The proposal was written based on the specific guidelines of the Clarence T.C. Ching Foundation's [application procedure](https://www.clarencetcchingfoundation.org/grant-seekers/). |
