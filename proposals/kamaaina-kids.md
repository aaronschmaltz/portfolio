# Purpose and History of the Organization

Kama’aina Kids is a non-profit organization that provides education and enrichment programs and services to the children and families of Hawaii. The organization started as an after-school program at Heeia State Park in 1987, initially serving 45 children. The program expanded at the park over the next five years before eventually culminating into a multi-program and multi-site operation. The organization employs over 1,000 staff with roughly 9,700 children provided care daily. Our mission is “to Serve the children, families and our communities by providing ongoing quality education and enrichment programs to help build a sense of Self, Community and Environment."

# Project Narrative

## Problem Statement

Childcare is an integral service for families that provides their children with an extracurricular means of developing additional skillsets and stability for parents and guardians with work-related obligations. However, without an active universal childcare program in the country, federal funding for childcare has been mostly limited to the Head Start program and childcare subsidies (Conley, 2010). Since most childcare programs in the country are not publicly funded, parents must cover the majority of childcare costs through fees (Conley, 2010).

As a result, low-income families in Hawaii struggle to deal with the costs and accessibility of childcare programs. According to the Economic Policy Institute, childcare is unaffordable for most families in Hawaii, taking up to 16% of a median family’s income for one child (n.d.). In addition, the child poverty rate in Hawaii is roughly 12%, and 23% of single-parent families with related children are below the poverty line (Spotlight on Poverty & Opportunity, n.d.). While subsidy programs exist to ameliorate the lack of affordability for some families, many families across the state cannot participate in childcare programs due to financial (e.g., affordability) and nonfinancial (e.g., accessibility) barriers.

## Project Description

The After-School Plus (A+) program at Kama‘aina Kids provides school-age children with additional education opportunities that go beyond the traditional scope of an in-school curriculum, including enrichment activities and camps. We currently partner with SPARK, a research-based organization that aims to improve children’s health. The A+ program’s curriculum and lesson plans integrate aspects of the SPARK-related programs that promote wellness and self-confidence. The program currently offers a variety of indoor and outdoor activities, which include but are not limited to study halls, sports, crafts, and music.

Funds for the proposal will be allocated to a 2022-2023 school year financial aid and scholarship program, which will provide families full access to the A+ program without the standard tuition and enrollment fees. We plan to expand the number of recipients beyond our established financial aid and scholarship program for the upcoming school year. Traditionally, the financial aid and scholarship program has been funded through individual donations, limiting the number of potential recipients. With grant contributions dedicated towards a new school-year-specific scholarship program, we can double the number of scholarship recipients from the previous school year.

## Goals and Objectives

Through this scholarship program, we aim to provide 25 low-income, school-aged children with a full year (i.e., 12 months) of enrollment in our A+ program during the 2022-2023 school year with no additional cost to the families. These children will engage in the same activities as any other participant.

## Evaluation Plan

During the registration process for the 2022-2023 school year, Kama‘aina Kids staff will review the income documentation and financial assistance status of applicants. These documents will provide our staff with enough background information to assess the financial needs of the families. Viable candidates will be allocated to a reserved pool for potential scholarships. Once the registration process has been completed, the board of directors will assess the potential candidates and select at least 25 children based on eligibility criteria. We will contact the families and offer scholarships until 25 children are enrolled in the 2022-2023 scholarship program.

Site Coordinators are responsible for administering the A+ program, supervising other staff, collecting data, and evaluating the program and curriculum. At the end of each month, Site Coordinators will complete reports and evaluation forms, which will then be given to the District Director and Complex Supervisor. Additionally, Group Leaders are responsible for executing the childcare activities and providing feedback to Site Coordinators for quality assurance, control, and assessment.

# Current Status of the Program

Since its inception in 1989, we have continued to expand the reach and number of locations of the A+ program. The program is currently being offered at 86 different locations and across multiple islands. For the upcoming 2022-2023 school year, we plan to double the number of scholarship recipients from last year through the new scholarship program. The scholarship program for the 2022-2023 school year will begin on August 20, 2022, and end on August 19, 2023.

# Amount Requested

We are requesting a total of $60,000 for the proposed program.

# Budget

The A+ program’s standard monthly tuition rate of $200 (or $2,400 per year) per student covers the expenses incurred by Kama‘aina Kids; the organization receives no additional revenue from tuition fees. The standard registration fee of $50 will be waived for scholarship recipients. The following budget covers the expenses involved with the enrollment of 25 students.
