# Portfolio
This repository is a collection of my writing (and non-writing) samples, showcasing some of the work that I have done.

| Title | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [Google Drawings](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/guides/google-drawings.md) | Guide | An introductory guide on how to use the Google Drawings diagramming software. Intended for internal use by Hawaii Aquatics employees with limited graphics experience; they were primarily expected to modify preexisting images. |
| [Drowning in Oahu](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/infographics/drowning-infographic.png) | Infographic | An infographic presenting information on drowning in Oahu, Hawaii, including drowning preventative measures. |
| [Aquatic Safety Education for Hawaii Elementary Schools](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/proposals/aquatic-safety-education.md) | Proposal | The primary proposal document for Hawaii Aquatics that was used as the basis for grant proposals. I edited and wrote a significant portion of the document (roughly 50%). |
| [Kama’aina Kids](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/proposals/kamaaina-kids.md) | Proposal | A grant proposal for a scholarship program that expands on Kama’aina Kids' preexisting After-School Plus (A+) program. The grant proposal was written to adhere to the specific guidelines of the Clarence T.C. Ching Foundation's [application procedure](https://www.clarencetcchingfoundation.org/grant-seekers/). |
| [COVID-19 Report](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/reports/covid-19.md) | Report | My portion of a collaborative COVID-19-related report. |
