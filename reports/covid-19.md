## Impact on Healthcare Costs

Janssen Scientific Affairs performed a study that examined healthcare resource use, direct healthcare costs, and long-term COVID-19-related complications between patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and subjects without COVID-19 (i.e., controls). COVID-19 and control patients were paired 1-to-1 (with a total of 150,731 pairs) and categorized into two separate cohorts: commercial and Medicare, denoting the different types of health plans. Various healthcare costs were evaluated during a 6-month follow-up period (DeMartino et al., 2022).

For the commercial cohort, the average total direct healthcare costs for COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than control patients, with a mean monthly cost over twice as high. For COVID-19 patients, total healthcare costs were primarily increased by mean inpatient (IP) expenses, which decreased substantially following the first month. Other expenses, such as emergency department (ED) and outpatient (OP), displayed similar trends, sharply decreased with the start of the second month before incrementally decreasing in subsequent months. Comparatively, healthcare costs for control patients were far more consistent (DeMartino et al., 2022).

Like the commercial cohort, the average total direct healthcare costs for COVID-19 patients in the Medicare cohort were significantly higher than control patients (with an even higher degree of disparity for mean monthly costs). Despite a significant decrease in average costs for IP- and ED-related expenses following the first month, mean total healthcare costs for COVID-19 patients were substantially higher than control patients through the fifth month. Like the control patients in the commercial cohort, healthcare costs for control patients in the Medicare cohort were relatively consistent (DeMartino et al., 2022).

Although the mean healthcare costs for COVID-19 patients were reduced significantly following the first month (for both cohorts), their average total healthcare costs far exceeded those of control patients. In addition, the incremental burden of compounding healthcare costs increased with older age groups; patients aged 50-64 had a mean difference of total healthcare costs of $7,117 (DeMartino et al., 2022).

## Recommendation

While the full ramifications of COVID-19 are difficult to ascertain, given its recent advent and the lack of conclusive data, the pandemic's severity could have been reduced if the American healthcare system was more robust and accessible. Our recommendation to address the myriad of issues considers the data we have assessed and the perspectives of various health experts.

**Legislative Policy Reform:**

The United States spends a disproportionate amount on health care expenses compared to other high-income nations, doubling or nearly doubling their health consumption expenditures per capita (McGough et al., 2023). To narrow the gap, we suggest restructuring our healthcare system on a national level to a single-payer system, emulating other countries. The costs for healthcare in a single-payer system are covered by a single entity whose funds are collected from the public. While single-payer healthcare systems are still prone to health disparities, an estimated $105.6 billion of COVID-19-related hospitalization expenses could have been avoided with a single-payer system (DeMartino et al., 2022). Successful reform will ultimately require a coordinated national effort of coalition building, policy proposals, political advocacy, and other strategies.
