# Portfolio
This repository is a collection of my writing (and non-writing) samples, showcasing some of the work that I have done.

| Title | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [Google Drawings](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/guides/google-drawings.md) | Guide | An introductory guide on how to use the Google Drawings diagramming software. Originally intended for internal use where the users, with a limited graphics background, were primarily expected to modify preexisting images. |
| [Drowning in Oahu](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/infographics/drowning-infographic.png) | Infographic | An infographic presenting information on drowning in Oahu, Hawaii, including drowning preventative measures. |
| [Aquatic Safety Education for Hawaii Elementary Schools](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/proposals/aquatic-safety-education.md) | Proposal | The primary proposal document for Hawaii Aquatics that was used as the basis for grant proposals. I edited and wrote a significant portion of the document (roughly 50%). |
| [Kama’aina Kids](https://github.com/aaronschmaltz/portfolio/blob/main/proposals/kamaaina-kids.md) | Proposal | A proposal based on a scholarship program that would act as an expansion to Kama’aina Kids' preexisting After-School Plus (A+) program. The grant proposal was written based on the specific guidelines of the Clarence T.C. Ching Foundation's [application procedure](https://www.clarencetcchingfoundation.org/grant-seekers/). |
