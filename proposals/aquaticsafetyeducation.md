# Aquatic Safety Education for Hawaii Elementary Schools

## Abstract

Drowning is a leading cause of death for Hawaii's children. Although Hawaii is an island state, our keiki are inadequately prepared for water-related emergencies. Equal access to standards-based aquatic safety education is essential to reduce the risk of both fatal and nonfatal childhood drownings throughout the state. The most effective path to reach the highest number of children is to support our elementary schools with the resources necessary to provide water safety and swim skill instruction during school hours. By implementing aquatic injury prevention curricula that align with state and national health and physical education standards, participating schools are able to enhance the health and well-being of their students.

## Organization history and purpose

The Hawaii Aquatics Foundation (HAF) is dedicated to improving the healthy development of Hawaii’s children and families by providing, promoting, and supporting aquatic injury prevention education and research. HAF is an IRS 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization that was established in 2017. The foundation was formed in response to drowning being the leading cause of injury death for Hawaii’s children (ages 1-14)[[1]](#_ftn1) and Hawaii having the second highest drowning rate per capita for all ages in the nation.

The Hawaii Aquatics Academy (HAA), the education branch of HAF, is a leader in providing comprehensive aquatic safety education content and services to Hawaii’s schools. Our objectives are in line with national and international drowning prevention strategies. HAA’s childhood education programs promote safety and well-being for all of Hawaii’s children, regardless of their physical condition or their cultural, social, or economic circumstances, through a combination of classroom- and pool-based instructional activities.

In addition to providing youth aquatic safety education services, HAF performs research to support the advocacy and development of a broad range of aquatic injury intervention initiatives. Our data-driven research has been used to affirm long-standing local assumptions, consistent with national studies, that children in Hawaii’s lower-income areas are at a disadvantage with respect to personal aquatic safety competencies and the protective factors they provide.

Since our inception, over 2,500 students from twenty-five public and charter elementary schools have participated in our during-school-hours aquatic safety education program. The participating schools represented seven different Hawaii Department of Education (HIDOE) complex areas on the islands of Hawaii, Kauai, Maui, and Oahu.

## Problem statement

According to the Hawaii Department of Health, from 2014 through 2018, injuries were responsible for more deaths of Hawaii’s children (ages 1-14) than all other causes, including infectious and chronic diseases. During the same time period, drowning was the leading cause of unintentional injury death for Hawaii’s children.[[1]](#_ftn1)

From 2014 through 2018, nonresidents accounted for 54% of the fatal drownings in Hawaii for all ages combined. By contrast, Hawaii’s children (ages 0-17) accounted for 96% of the fatal child drownings — occurring in places such as homes, beaches, and inland waterways (e.g., ponds, reservoirs, and streams). During the same 5-year period, there was an annual average of 70 EMS-attended nonfatal child drownings in Hawaii.[[2]](#_ftn2) Nonfatal drowning injuries can cause severe brain damage, similar to blunt force trauma, and can result in long-term disabilities, such as memory problems, learning disabilities, and permanent loss of basic functioning (i.e., permanent vegetative state).

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “Most drowning deaths and injuries are predictable and preventable.”[[3]](#_ftn3) The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Report on Drowning states that “Long-term declines in drowning in a number of countries are associated with the establishment and community actions of lifesaving societies.”[[4]](#_ftn4) The International Life Saving Federation’s (ILS) position statement for Swimming and Water Safety Education provides the following:

- Death by drowning is a leading public health problem in all countries. Prevention requires public and government support.
- The vast majority of deaths by drowning can be prevented.
- Everyone, ideally commencing at a young age and regardless of ability and background, should have access to training in water safety, personal survival, and water rescue.
- Knowledge and understanding of water environments and their associated hazards should be taught to everyone at the earliest possible age.[[5]](#_ftn5)

## Needs assessment

A statewide school survey was conducted by HAF during the spring of 2017. The survey identified that less than 10% of Hawaii’s public and charter elementary schools and less than 20% of the state's private elementary schools provide aquatic safety instruction — for any grade — during their physical education classes. Lack of dedicated funding for bussing transportation, instruction specialists, and lifeguards were cited as the primary reasons for not being able to implement school-supported programs. Further, existing extracurricular options have limited accessibility as the costs of private lessons are too expensive for many families and municipal programs do not have the resources to meet public demand. Other factors that influence parents’ decision to not have their children participate in water safety programs include their cultural upbringing, fearfulness of the water, and overconfidence in their own children’s knowledge and abilities.

Nationally, both the fatal and nonfatal drowning rates are higher for children who are in low socioeconomic or ethnic minority groups. In the fall of 2019, HAF completed an income disparity report of 947 Hawaii second-grade-aged students (ages 7-8) from fifteen different schools in five HIDOE complex areas over a two-year period. The report, consistent with national findings, provides direct evidence that Hawaii’s children from lower-income areas are at a disadvantage with significantly reduced water safety and swim skill abilities when compared to moderate-income and higher-income areas. In addition to the opportunity gap identified for lower-income groups, the data summarized in Table 1 and Figure 1 below affirms the need for formal aquatic safety education for all children.

An early 1980s study performed by the City and County of Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation found that 70% of a tested group of 4,500 students, 7-14 years in age, were unable to swim 50 yards.[[6]](#_ftn6) HAA’s 2018-19 school year report of 564 second grade-aged students identified similar deficiencies in multiple protective skills. The students were assessed during their first in-water lesson for proficiency relative to grade level benchmarks in three basic aquatic motor skills: floating, treading, and swimming. As presented in Table 1, only 31% of the students could swim for 25 yards. Further, only 13% of the students were able to tread for 60 seconds, and only 12% were able to float for 30 seconds.

Table 1

*Pre-Instruction Assessments*

| Level / Skill | Un-satisfactory | Progressing | Satisfactory |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Float | < 15 secs | 15–29 secs | 30+ secs |
| | 73% | 15% | 12% |
| Tread | < 20 secs | 20–59 secs | 60+ secs |
| | 61% | 26% | 13% |
| Swim | < 10 yards | 10–24 yards | 25+ yards |
| | 40% | 29% | 31% |

The American Red Cross states that proficiency in multiple aquatic skills has been identified as a key requirement of personal aquatic safety competency.[[7]](#_ftn7) For example, self-recovery situations often require the ability to temporarily halt swimming to float and recover or to tread in a fixed position and scan for hazards. As illustrated in Figure 1, 63% of the students assessed at the start of the course were unable to satisfactorily demonstrate the grade level benchmark in any of the three basic aquatic motor skills. While 37% of the students were able to satisfactorily demonstrate at least one of the skills, only 16% were able to satisfactorily demonstrate two or more of the skills, and just 2% were able to satisfactorily demonstrate all three of the skills.

## Goals and objectives

Drowning prevention experts recommend that multiple promotive and protective factors, such as school-sponsored aquatic safety education, be employed as it is unlikely that any single strategy will prevent all childhood drowning deaths and injuries. A long-term goal of HAF is for all of Hawaii’s elementary, middle, and high schools to include aquatic injury prevention education in their health and physical education curricula — similar to countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. In support of this goal, the 2023–24 school year objectives for our elementary school program are:

- To provide Health and Physical Education standards-aligned aquatic safety and swim skill instruction through classroom- and pool-based programming statewide for 2,500 public and charter elementary school students
- To reduce the learning opportunity gap in aquatic safety and swim skill competence in lower- and moderate-income areas
- To raise awareness of parental and community roles in childhood aquatic injury prevention safety promotion

## Program activities

The real-world circumstances that limit the accessibility of aquatic safety education programs must be considered when determining curriculum priorities. Well over half of elementary school students have not had formal water safety or swim skill instruction prior to participating in HAA’s school-supported programs. Additionally, for many students, including those who participate in water activities, a during-school-hours course will be the only structured aquatic safety instruction they receive during their childhood development years. These conditions, coupled with the possibility that the knowledge and skills learned today could save a student tomorrow, influence the content and learning objectives of HAA’s curricula and instructional activities.

The development of personal aquatic safety competence requires more than traditional learn-to-swim instruction. Effective injury prevention education prepares students with the attitudes, knowledge, skills, and experience necessary for both the avoidance of and the recovery from hazardous situations. Accordingly, the learning objectives of our curricula are:

- Development of aquatic safety knowledge and positive attitudes
- Development of safe behaviors and risk-management skills
- Development of aquatic motor skills and survival skills

The lesson plans for our elementary school curriculum consist of one hour of classroom-based cognitive skill instruction (typically two 30-minute lessons) and four hours of pool-based cognitive and physical skill instruction (typically eight 30-minute lessons). The students are taught a variety of aquatic safety knowledge and survival swim skills, such as the identification of local hazards, risk management, personal limits, safe entries and exits, life jacket use, multiple techniques for floating, treading, and orienting, and front-, back-, and side-positioned swimming.

Our program is integrated with each school’s existing curriculum requirements and scheduling constraints through careful planning and coordination with their administration, teachers, and special education assistants. Four distinct areas of tasks and responsibilities are:

| **Scheduling and logistics** | **Student safety and well-being** |
| :--- | :--- |
| ● Coordinating with participating schools | ● Providing safety equipment |
| ● Scheduling pool facility reservations | ● Supporting school chaperones |
|	● Organizing transportation | ● Ensuring an average instructor-student ratio of 1:4 |
| ● Scheduling instructors and support staff | ● Facilitating instructor, staff, and volunteer training |
| ● Procuring appropriate swimwear for students in lower-income areas |  |
| **Instructional activities** | **Post-instruction activities** |
| ● Developing lesson plans | ● Distributing parent safety information |
| ● Tracking attendance | ● Analyzing student assessment data |
|	● Providing instruction | ● Generating student performance reports and school summaries |
| ● Performing assessments | ● Producing annual statewide reports |
| ● Accommodating special needs students |  |

## Outcomes

Program performance outcomes and quality assurance objectives are measured by evaluating student pre- and post-instruction performance assessments and by the total number of participating schools and students. The recording and analysis of school and student participation and evaluation data is used to evaluate individual students, each school, geographical areas, socioeconomic groups, and other categorizations relative to statewide averages. Upon course completion, school teachers are provided a detailed performance report for each student’s proficiency relative to grade level performance benchmarks, competency objectives, and HIDOE Health and Physical Education Standards.

Analysis of pre- and post-instruction assessments provides insight into the overall aquatic safety competence and skill progression of participating students and also for subcohorts, such as students with an extreme fear of water. HAA’s 2018-19 report of 564 second-grade-aged students on the islands of Kauai, Maui, and Oahu demonstrated that the majority of participating students were able to make significant improvements in their ability to perform one or more of the fundamental skills taught during the course.

In addition to the knowledge- and skill-oriented competencies that are developed through HAA’s instructional activities, lessons include affective domain learning objectives that foster the development of students’ positive attitudes, behaviors, and values specific to aquatic activities and environments.

The student learning outcomes for our aquatic safety competency learning objectives are aligned with state and national health and physical education standards and benchmarks. By the end of the course, students will:

- Demonstrate safe behaviors in, on, and around aquatic environments
- Demonstrate positive attitudes and values toward aquatic safety
- Demonstrate knowledge of risk management and personal assessment concepts
- Demonstrate knowledge of local hazards and avoidance strategies
- Demonstrate proficiency improvement in multiple swim skills
- Demonstrate rescue, self-recovery, and survival skills

## Other impacts

HAF’s programs and community outreach efforts incorporate health and wellness injury prevention education theory to address social determinants of health (SDOH) for Hawaii’s children and families. Our curricula incorporate elements of the CDC’s social-ecological model for injury prevention, which highlights the complex interplay between individual, relationship, community, and societal factors.

Student engagement, social development, self-confidence, and self-dependence are all enhanced through teaching methods applied by instructors while in a controlled aquatic environment. Primary teachers have observed that their students are more attentive and invested after participation, and the social connection between them is enhanced due to the experiences they shared at the pool.

It is widely accepted that student attendance is a powerful predictor of academic success. In the Honolulu Civil Beat article “Why Nearly Half The Kids In An Island State Can’t Swim” (November 4, 2019), Ned Uemae, principal at Kauluwela Elementary in Kalihi, noted that more students showed up to school on the days his four second grade classes were scheduled to have pool lessons with HAA. Uemae stated, “That’s one of the challenges we have — making sure kids come to school every day. When they come back [from the pool] and I see them, they’re so happy.”

## Program timeline

The timeline for the 2023–24 school year of the program is aligned with the HIDOE school quarters (Q1–Q4). The number of students per quarter is distributed evenly throughout the school year, with the exception of a reduced number during the months of January through March (i.e., Q3) due to cooler pool water temperatures in non-heated pools. The distribution across islands and HIDOE complex areas will vary from quarter to quarter based on each school’s preferences and pool facility availability. The planned distribution of students is as follows:

| Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 600 students | 700 students | 500 students | 700 students |

## Personnel and qualifications

HAF’s headquarter staff consists of five full-time staff members, and each Hawaii, Kauai, Maui, and Oahu island team has seven or more part-time staff. Island directors provide supervision for their local teams, which are comprised of a school liaison, team leader, trained water safety instructors, and certified lifeguards. Headquarter support staff assist each team with logistical tasks, such as school and facility scheduling, and with staff training to ensure a consistent level of instruction across all islands. HAA is an American Red Cross Licensed Training Provider.

## Budget

The program’s statewide budget for the 2023–24 school year is $500,000. Approximately half of the program funding has been secured from prior donors with the remaining funds to be raised from new sources. Program funds are used to pay for instructors, lifeguards, student transportation, and other direct program expenses. If less than the anticipated amount of funding is procured, the scope of the program will be adjusted accordingly.

## Funding

We continually pursue additional sources of funding and grant opportunities for ongoing research, program development, and the expansion of our statewide services. Solicited donors include private and public non-profit organizations, local and national foundations, small and large individual donors, and county and state grants.

## Conclusion

In order to reduce the risk of childhood drowning in our state, we believe every child should be provided equal access to a standards-based aquatic safety education during school hours. This data-driven position is affirmed by the reality that the majority of Hawaii’s children lack the set of basic skills necessary for drowning avoidance and self-recovery. The intervention of HAA’s school-supported program, as further evidenced by the evaluation of post-instruction assessment data, demonstrates that measurable progress can be achieved toward a child’s development of personal aquatic safety competence regardless of their physical condition or their cultural, social, or economic circumstances.

Providing Hawaii’s elementary schools with the resources and expertise necessary to implement comprehensive aquatic safety education programs is the most effective path to reach the highest number of children. The goals of HAF’s aquatic injury prevention programs are aligned with the recommendations of the CDC, ILS, WHO, and other internationally recognized organizations and researchers. We look forward to the opportunity of working with like-minded community partners toward our shared goal of promoting the health and well-being of Hawaii’s children. Together we can make a difference by helping “To prepare the children of Hawaii with the attitudes, knowledge, skills, and experience they need to become Water Safer for Life®.”
